    "Classifying social media ads means analyzing your social media ads for finding the most profitable customers for your product who are more likely to buy the product. Sometimes the product you are offering is not suitable for all people when it comes to age and income. For example, a person between the ages of 20 and 25 may like to spend more on smartphone covers than a person between the ages of 40 and 45.\n",

    "- __Sklearn__ : Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. The library is built upon the SciPy (Scientific Python) that must be installed before you can use scikit-learn.\n",

The idea is that this character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another python script.\n",
